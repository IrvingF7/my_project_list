# Introduction
This repo contains pointers to all my projects that can be publicly shared.

## Projects
### Robotics
- EVSIvsLSTM
  - A research project of BEST Lab at UC Berkeley that explore adaptive mobile sensor placement using the concept of Expected Value of Information and deep learning. More details can be found in the paper. Work presented at IMECE 2021.
  - [Github Link](https://github.com/BerkeleyExpertSystemTechnologiesLab/EVSIvsLSTM)
  - [Paper Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.07552)

- Potential Field Swarm
  - An robotics class final project that use potential field theory and edge tension function to control a swarm of robots to achieve some non-trivial tasks in PyBullet environment.
  - [Github Link](https://github.com/IrvingF7/potential_field_swarm)



- slalomTello
  - A control class project that design a controller to let the drone navigate slalom posts.
  - [Github Link](https://github.com/IrvingF7/slalomTello)

- Predator@Cal
  - An robotics class experimental project simulating predator and prey movement using swarm robots.
  - [Github Link](https://github.com/IrvingF7/Predator-Cal)
  
- Trash Cleaner Baxter
  - An robotics class final project involving robot using R-CNN to identify different kinds of trashes and cleaning it with appropriate tools.

### Computer Vision
- VPR_VLAD
  - A project that uses SIFT-based and [Superpoint](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2018_workshops/papers/w9/DeTone_SuperPoint_Self-Supervised_Interest_CVPR_2018_paper.pdf)-based [VLAD feature](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6619051) to build a large scale VPR (Visual Place Recognition) system. Given a query, you can retrieve images similar to the query from a database of images.

- Memorability
  - A research project of Multimedia group at UC Berkeley that utilize multi-modal ensemble models to predict videos' short and long term memorability. Work presented at MediaEval 2021
  - [Github Link](https://github.com/cooliotonyio/predicting-media-memorability)
  - [Paper Link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.01173.pdf)

### FPGA
- NYU-6463-RV32I
  - A RISC-V CPU written in Verilog. It can (almost) directly run C code by compiling it to RISC-V Assembly and then machine code.
  - [Github Link](https://github.com/darcy-anderson/processor-design-project) (Under Construction)

### Embedded System
- Just Breath
  - A Piezoelectric sensor based device that can detect sudden breathing stop in infants. 
  - Implemented on STM32F429 MCU
  - [Github Link](https://github.com/jesseinouye/ECE-GY6483-F22_Just-Breath-Challenge) (Github Construction)

### Others
- Cal Awe Project
  - A psychology research project at UC Berkeley that involves using LDA model and TF-IDF to process survey and Twitter data to better understand the feeling of awe.
